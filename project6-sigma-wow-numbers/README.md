# Sigma Workout Wednesday: Numbers of Different Magnitudes

This submission showcases AI-assisted vibe coding in Sigma: building a custom React + D3 plugin that goes beyond out-of-the-box visual options while staying fully interactive with Sigma filters.

## Why this matters
Sigma users can now co-create bespoke visuals and narrative layers with AI, then deploy them directly in dashboards. This unlocks faster experimentation, enghanced storytelling, and design patterns not currently available in native chart types.

## What this plugin adds
- Side-by-side magnitude + trend storytelling layout
- Dynamic narrative insights driven by filtered data
- Income cohort segmentation and chronological trend animation
- Inline data labels and cohort endpoint labels
- Professional presentation styling for stakeholder-ready communication
